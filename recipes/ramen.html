    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <p>
      But I’d like to try to encourage you to go to the Packaged Ramen + level
      with this recipe. I mean, when you can make your own yummy broth in 20
      minutes? And it’s delicate and light and full of flavor, in a more fresh
      and veg-heavy way? That is the way to do it, says Adult Me.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ramen noodles (our classic Maruchan package is all we need, sans the
        seasoning!)
      </li>
      <li>Garlic and ginger</li>
      <li>Broth (chicken or veg)</li>
      <li>Dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
      <li>Veggies like carrots or kale</li>
      <li>All your favorite toppings like some panko, egg, chili oil, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Stir-Fry Aromatics</strong>: Garlic and ginger, what a delicious
        duo. This is where the flavor is, friends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make Your (Easy!) Broth</strong>: Add some chicken broth and
        dried shiitake mushrooms for some umami punch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Noodles</strong>: Cook your noodles right in the broth with
        some scallions (more flavor, please!).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Veg</strong>: Thinly sliced kale, shredded carrots, whatever
        you’d like! Cook until just tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Top It Off</strong>: Add some crunchy panko crumbs, a
        soft-boiled egg, chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce,
        whatever your heart desires.
      </li>
    </ol>
