      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375Â°F (190Â°C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook ground beef, breaking it
        up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 15
        minutes. Drain the excess fat and transfer the beef to a bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the same skillet, heat olive oil and sautÃ© onion and garlic until
        soft and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add tomato sauce, tomato paste,
        water, sugar, basil, oregano, salt and pepper and bring to a boil.
        Reduce the heat and simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring
        occasionally.
      </li>

      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together ricotta cheese, egg and parsley.</li>
      <li>
        To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of
        the prepared baking dish. Arrange 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce,
        slightly overlapping them. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the
        noodles, followed by half of the mozzarella cheese and half of the
        parmesan cheese. Spoon half of the beef over the cheese layer and pour
        1/3 of the remaining sauce over the beef. Repeat with another layer of
        noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, parmesan, beef and sauce. Top with the
        final layer of noodles and spread the remaining sauce over them.
        Sprinkle with more mozzarella and parmesan cheese.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
        the foil and bake for another 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted
        and bubbly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
